### Data:

Data can be acquired from the following website, but I attached also the data separated to two files as "Death" and "Vaccinations":
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Warning: The data might be changed over time!

### Data Exploration:

I explored the data using sql commands and by grouping different parameters to investigate the deaths and vaccinations in different countries.


### Data Visualization:

I have used the outcomes of the data exploration as an input in Tableau to visualize certain statistics.

The Dashboard can be accessed through the following link:
